				</ul>
				<p class="pt10 m0">Upon successful processing of a deletion request, we will remove or anonymize your
					data in
					accordance with industry standards while ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory
					requirements.
				</p>
				<h2 class="pt20 m0">6. Data Security</h2>
				<p class="pt10 m0">At Arbitrage Markets, we prioritize the security of user data and implement
					industry-standard
					measures to protect it from unauthorized access, misuse, and loss. However, while we take
					extensive precautions, no system is entirely immune to security threats. This section outlines our
					data protection protocols, limitations, and user responsibilities in maintaining security.</p>

				<h3 class="pt10 m0">6.1 Security Measures Implemented</h3>
				<p class="pt10 m0">We employ multiple layers of security to safeguard user data, including:</p>
				<ul class="pt10 m0">
					<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All sensitive user data, including personal and financial
						information, is encrypted
						both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols.</li>
					<li><strong>Secure Servers:</strong> Our platform is hosted on secure servers with firewalls,
						intrusion detection, and
						continuous monitoring to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
					<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We enforce strict access policies, ensuring that only
						authorized personnel can
						access user data, and only for legitimate operational purposes.</li>
					<li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Where applicable, we encourage or require
						users to enable
						MFA for added account security.</li>
					<li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We conduct routine security assessments, vulnerability
						testing, and
						compliance audits to maintain platform integrity.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="pt10 m0">6.2 Limitations of Security</h3>
				<p class="pt10 m0">While we employ robust security protocols, users must acknowledge that:</p>
				<ul class="pt10 m0">
					<li><strong>No online system is 100% secure:</strong> Despite our best efforts, there is always a
						potential risk of
						security breaches, cyberattacks, or system vulnerabilities.</li>
					<li><strong>External factors may compromise security:</strong> Third-party services, exchange
						integrations, or user-end vulnerabilities (e.g., malware, phishing attacks) may pose security
						risks beyond our control.</li>
					<li><strong>Users should take proactive security measures:</strong> We strongly encourage users to
						follow best
						practices to protect their accounts and personal data.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="pt10 m0">6.3 User Responsibilities in Maintaining Security</h3>
				<p class="pt10 m0">To enhance account security and reduce risks, users must:</p>
				<ul class="pt10 m0">
					<li><strong>Keep login credentials confidential:</strong> Users must not share their passwords, API
						keys, or any
						authentication details with anyone.</li>
					<li><strong>Use strong passwords:</strong> A unique, complex password should be used, and it should
						be changed
						periodically.</li>
					<li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> This provides an additional layer of
						protection against
						unauthorized access.</li>
					<li><strong>Beware of phishing and scams:</strong> Users should be cautious of suspicious emails,
						fake websites,
						or fraudulent communication claiming to be from Arbitrage Markets.</li>
					<li><strong>Regularly update security settings:</strong> Keeping devices, browsers, and
						authentication methods up
						to date reduces vulnerability to attacks.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="pt10 m0">In the event of a suspected security breach, users must immediately notify Arbitrage
					Markets so
					that appropriate action can be taken.</p>
				<h2 class="pt20 m0">7. User Rights</h2>
				<p class="pt10 m0">At Arbitrage Markets, we recognize and respect users’ rights concerning their
					personal data. In

						user’s account settings.</li>
					<li>For certain data, such as KYC documentation, users may be required to submit verification
						documents to process the correction request.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="pt10 m0">7.3 Data Deletion Requests</h3>
				<p class="pt10 m0">Users can request the deletion of their personal data; however, this is subject to:
				</p>
				<ul class="pt10 m0">
					<li><strong>Regulatory and compliance obligations:</strong> Certain financial and transactional data
						must be
						retained for a minimum of 5–7 years as per anti-money laundering (AML) and financial
						regulations.</li>
					<li><strong>Pending transactions or disputes:</strong> If an account has unresolved disputes or
						transactions,

					<li>However, users will continue to receive non-marketing communications, such as transactional
						updates, security alerts, and service notifications.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="pt10 m0">7.5 Data Portability</h3>
				<ul class="pt10 m0">
					<li>Users have the right to request a copy of their personal data in a structured, commonly used,
						and
						machine-readable format. This allows users to transfer their data to another service provider if
						desired.</li>
					<li>Requests for data portability can be submitted through customer support.</li>
					<li>Data will be provided in a secure format and may require identity verification before
						processing.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="pt10 m0">7.6 Exercising User Rights</h3>
